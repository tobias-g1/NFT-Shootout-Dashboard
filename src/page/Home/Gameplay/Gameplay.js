                <p>NFT Shootout is a turn-based Penalty Shootout strategy system, where you put your player NFTs up against other gamerâ€™s player NFTs in a live game. You will have 5 penalties each per game, alternating penalties with your opponent. The team with the most penalty conversions after 5 penalties are deemed the winner. In the event of a tie after 5 penalties, both teams will enter a sudden death penalty shootout. Winner takes all.</p>
